UNet :  Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

The u-net is convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images. 

Architecture (example for 32x32 pixels in the lowest resolution). Each blue box corresponds to a multi-channel feature map. 
The number of channels is denoted on top of the box. The x-y-size is provided at the lower left edge of the box. 
White boxes represent copied feature maps. The arrows denote the different operations.
